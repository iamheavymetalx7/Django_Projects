# Django_Projects

Django is a back-end server side web framework. It is free, open source and written in Python. It makes it easier to build web pages using Python.


**1. Website **

The first app "website" is a very basic app and not yet fully functional. I used this app to help me in learning, how to start django project, startapp and
the usage of models.py, views.py and urls.py and how they are connected. I also learned about the CRUD operations.


**2. ToDo App**
 Performs basic CRUD operations. The sample image is attached below. The app supports Create Read Update and DELETE functionalities.

Update:
- Improve the user interface of ToDo app on delete and update pages of the app.
- To make a  ToDo list app with User Registration, Login, and Search is the upcoming plan.


**3. ToDo List with User Authentication**

This app is a upgrade to the 2nd application. In this django project, we make use of the Django Class based Views instead of function based views.

Function based views are a little more explicit and easier to understand while class based views require a little more understanding of how to use these classes and built in methods, but Class based views are very powerful.

There was a point where django only had function based views. There were methods added to take care of common actions but extending functions can be very limiting so to fix this problem django added class based views.
