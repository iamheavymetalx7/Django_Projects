# Django_Projects

Django is a back-end server side web framework. It is free, open source and written in Python. It makes it easier to build web pages using Python.


1. Website

The first app "website" is a very basic app and not yet fully functional. I used this app to help me in learning, how to start django project, startapp and
the usage of models.py, views.py and urls.py and how they are connected. I also learned about the CRUD operations.


2. ToDo App
 Performs basic CRUD operations. The sample image is attached below. The app supports Create Read Update and DELETE functionalities.
