6. MVT (MODEL VIEW TEMPLATES) :
-  MVT is a softwre design pattern
- Model : is going to act as interface of your data
- View : The view is the user interface - what you see in browser when you render a website.
- Templates: consists of the static parts of the desired HTML output as 


                    model
URl - django - view
                    template



<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
- manage.py - used for migrate or managing project, runing project.


- Create these file:
templates - all html files
static - stores statics files: javascript, images, etc
media - dynamic image or dynamic files


-- django creates a same folder inside, which is called app. 

--python manage.py makemigrations : to be use when we make new model for migrate and then use
python manage.py migrate
-- migrate to create table



----------------

website is divided into two parts : main url which is viewed by user and admin panel where
client adds data and keeps on adding on the website



---------

urls and views in django
urls can be considered as routes. 

view is called when u hit a url. Two ways: POST and GET
all urls are connected to views. Views are of two types : functions and class based

urls.py  - all urls defined
views.py - to be created, the connect these two files.


Total no. of views = total no. of urls

no. of urls = functions of views


------------------

dynamic routes : slug changes, the data on the page changes but the page remains the same!!


routes:
integer
string
slug : it is of the type hello-web-ii
-----------------

2:55 - 3:23 
{% include %} - common section, that can be included each url

{%extend} - header and footer included and in between the data can be changed everytime
and we keep extending the base.html

url - inside urls.py 
two methods: 
1.direct : using '/about-us' used in views.py
2. url tag: name="contact" or something give name, then use names 
{% url 'contact' %}


-------------
HTTP request methods in django:

1. GET method: The get method sends the encoded user information appended
to the page request. the page and the encoded information are 
separated by the ? character.

- uses key value pair in the url
- restricted to send upto 1024 characters only
- NEVER USE GET METHOD IF U HAVE PASSWORD OR 
OTHER sensitive information
-  cannot be used to send binary data, like images or word documents, to the server

2. POST method:
- POST method transfer informatio via HTTP headers
The information is encoded as described in case of GET METHOD andput ito a header called QUERY_STRING.

- no restriction on data size to be sensitive
- can be used to send ASCII as well as binary data
- the data sent by POST method goes thru HTTP reader
so security depends on HTTP protocol.
- by using secure HTTP you can make sure that your info is secure.


## Form needs an action and a method.

To use POST method we have to make use of CSRF token: when a form is submitted, django checks 
if form submitted is coming from same omain, django validates the same.

If token is used, npo spamminh is possible for that reason we use csrf token.


------------------------
## 4:08:00
page redirection :

functions :
1. we user the Httpresponseredirect method after we are done getting the input from the user
- We just ned to give the path where we need to redirect

when we use "action" attribute in forms, that means we can form submit on another url and
we can view other fn on url and then we can get the data.

if we dont use action, then userform url is reloaded and hit on the same page itself!!


------------------
Django forms model: creation and implementation

- to use django forms, we have to make forms.py inside the app folder

- there are many other fields for django forms for which one can check documentation (django)
